🌟 Welcome to My GitHub

Hi! I’m a software engineer in the making who loves building things and exploring what code can do.

👩‍💻 What I Do

🛠️ Build projects with React

💡 Constantly learning and pushing myself with new challenges

🎮 Outside of Code

♟️ Chess (strategy is my comfort zone)

📚 Reading

🎥 Movies to unwind

🚀 Philosophy

Life is an adventure—
I explore it one line of code at a time, balancing growth, creativity, and rest.
